# RoboSim
Robotics simulator

Currently:

- TestBed demonstrates a pseudo-CCD method of IK that I implemented.
- TestBed2 shows how to load and display STL files. It loads the arm models we've been provided so far. It also demonstrates working mouse camera controls.
- TestBed3 has the layout for a GUI that mimics the robot controller.
- RoboSim combines various elements from the test beds and is the in-progress version of the application.

TODO:

- Waiting to hear back regarding further requirements.
