Robotics simulator

Currently:

TestBed demonstrates a pseudo-CCD method of IK that I implemented.

TestBed2 shows how to load and display STL files. It loads the arm models we've been provided so far. It also demonstrates working mouse camera controls.

TestBed3 has the layout for a GUI that mimics the robot controller.

TODO:

- Waiting to hear back regarding further requirements.
