# RoboSim
Robotics simulator

Explanation of uploaded programs:

- TestBed contains a circle computation algorithm.
- TestBed2 shows how to load and display STL files. It loads the arm models we've been provided so far. It also demonstrates working mouse camera controls.
- TestBed3 has the layout for a GUI that mimics the robot controller.
- RoboSim combines James' and Ruimin's code and is the in-progress version of the application.

Currently Implementing:

- Working on the interface for programming the robotic arm.
- Getting circular motion instructions working.
